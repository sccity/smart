# SMART
The SMART (Sustainable Management and Assessment for Responsible Taxation) system is a suite of R scripts designed to perform statistical analysis for the purpose of determining an optimal property tax rate. Employing a data-driven methodology, the system incorporates algorithms to evaluate various parameters, including needs assessment, sustainability indicators, and economic variables. It introduces a nuanced approach to citizen impact management by implementing constraints on tax increases and incorporating rate caps. This technical framework facilitates a systematic examination of taxation dynamics, providing government entities with a robust toolset for objective decision-making in the realm of property tax policy.

WARNING: This system is still in active development and is not considered a finished product at this time. This warning will be removed once completed.
